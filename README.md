### Area of Focus:
The area the layers are all centered upon is Seattle, Washington. Each tileset is restricted to zoom levels 3-14. The first layer is the basemap I made, with a dark but still colored theme for an unobtrustive but visually interesting appearance. The second layer is a city dataset of [unreinforced masonry buildings](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::unreinforced-masonry-buildings-urm/about) that are vulnerable to earthquakes, which I found interesting. The third layer combines that pointmap over the basemap style I created, while the final map is a regular map using the color scheme of the Seattle Mariners, my absolute favorite sports team! Go Mariners!!! 🌊🔱⚾
